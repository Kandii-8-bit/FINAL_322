## Movie Library Description

This is an app where a user is supposed to be able to log in and log out to access a basic library
that keeps track of the films that they own. Once logged-in they're directed to the library page where they
should be able to search for the movie in their library they're looking for. They should also be able to delete a movie from
the library and add one at the bottom. An alert controller is supposed to be prompted upon clicking the button.
This would allow them to update their library with more movies! This app is not a full functioning CRUD app, I got stuck on
trying to log the user in which made it hard for me to pull my initial data. I still tend to really mixed up as to what all goes in the
service file then what goes into your different pages of the app. I also could not figure out how to get my images to show on the Web4 server they only work
locally.
